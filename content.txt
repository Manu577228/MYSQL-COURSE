-- Notes of the course --

-- SQL is not case sensitive

1) --  -> It is used to comment single line

2) AS -> is used to rename the same column name

3) SELECT, FROM, WHERE clause

4)some arithmatic operators used in SQL are :
a) >
b) >=
c) <
d) <=
e) = 
f) !=
g) <>


5) AND , OR , NOT, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, REGEXP, IS NULL Operators.

6) Instead of LIKE( % & _ ) operators we should always make use of REGEXP Oerator.

7) ORDER BY clause

8)JOIN Operations With ON

9) JOIN across DATABASES

10) INNER JOIN & OUTER JOIN

11) INNER JOIN uses only JOIN KEYWORD and OUTER JOIN uses LEFT & RIGHT JOIN

12)UNIONS ( connects rows from other tables)

13) INSERT ( Insert rows into table)
